# Stress Test Phase 4 February 2022

To test deployment of a new version of eQ runner whilst under load.

The test was conducted 3 times, one trial run in a separate GCP project before 2 tests using eq-stress-test-340815. The trial results have been included to highlight a potential issue with latency on deployment.

In each test, runner version v3.94.0 was upgraded to v3.95.0 The only exception was the last test which was downgraded from v3.95.0 to v3.94.0, this seemed a completely valid scenario and due to no breaking changes in the versions had no ill effect.

## Initial Benchmark

Prior to the test a benchmark was run to confirm the setup of eq-stress-test was relative to previous tests. The 99th Percentile was quicker than expected at 157ms, but was inside an acceptable range. A small number of 404s were recorded during the initial test (8 in 3 million requests) but were not investigated further.

## Results

Deployment of eQ runner took approximately 2 minutes in total, but it was the creation of the revision and the switching which was a surprise taking seconds from appearing to having 100% traffic.

Deployment was successful each time with no associated errors (there were a handful of secrets already existing, but I saw that as a separate issue).

Although deployment was successful in each test it was not completely seemless. Each test saw a spike in latency of the new instance at the time of switching, this lasted approximately 20 seconds.

The table below shows the amount of requests in that time period and the count of requests breaking particular thresholds.

## Conclusion
Whether it was the test settings or the timeliness of the instance switching there does seem to be a gap lasting approximately 20 seconds when the new instance has significantly higher latency.

The results of the test showed that 15% of requests at the time were above 2 seconds. In 2 of the tests aftershocks were also seen for the next 3-4 minutes, where a small proportion of requests also took greater than 2 seconds (approximately 50 requests).


## Next Steps

- Investigate the reason behind the short term latency increase.


## Additional Tests

After the results above it was decided to reduce the load and see if it had the same affect. Load injectors were halved to 11 and the test ran again.

The result was the same, out of 32,466 requests 3550 broke the 2 second threshold.
