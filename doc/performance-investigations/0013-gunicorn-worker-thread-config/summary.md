# Gunicorn worker and thread count configuration

Questionnaire runner currently uses the formula `(2 x $num_cores) + 1` when configuring the number of Gunicorn workers and threads. This results in 7 workers by 7 threads for our current vCPU count of 3.
This document highlights the results from running the application with different numbers of workers and thread permutations. Both workers and threads ranged from 1 to 10.

A client rate of 225 was chosen to achieve ~65/70% CPU usage. Prior to the 20 minute test, a 1 minute warm up test was run to reduce any cold start times.

### Performance comparison of thread counts

The following results were omitted because the 99th percentile response was above 500ms:
1. All workers with a thread count of 1
2. All permutations of 1 and 2 workers.

### Comparison of the 99th percentile between workers with a thread count of 2

The performance of the app does not seem to get noticeably better past 2 threads. The graph below highlights the performance of different workers under 2 threads over 3 runs.

![](images/performance_graph_workers_by_2_threads_99th_avg.png)

## Observations

- Using a thread count of 1 or worker count of 1 or 2 is not feasible.
- Our current configuration of 7 workers by 7 threads is not the most optimal.
- More than 2 threads did not have any noticeable advantages in response times.
- More than 4 workers does not seem to have any significant improvement in response times.

## Decision
- Since different configurations have different pros and cons for different percentiles, a few different worker/thread configurations should be tested further in small scale stress tests:
  - Compare a baseline of 7 workers with 7 threads vs 7 workers with 2 threads, until the 99th percentile reaches 1 second. 
  - Following on from that, run a test with a reduced number of workers.
- Run a stress test to discover how these new configurations compare at higher loads.
