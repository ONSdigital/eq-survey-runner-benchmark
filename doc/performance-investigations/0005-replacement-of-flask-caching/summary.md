# Replacement of Flask-Caching with built-in functools caching

An improvement in Datastore latencies was seen coinciding with the replacement of Flask caching with Python 3.8 built-in functools caching. 
This test was carried out to help understand if these gains were coincidental or whether there is potentially some bottlenecks in the way we initialise the Datastore client.

The tests documented here are like-for-like with our daily performance tests.

## Results

### Locust

Results are based on the 99th percentile timings and under the test conditions as detailed above in the benchmark profile.
The tests were repeated multiple times to verify the results. These results are averages between all the tests.

| Metric | Baseline | Investigation |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Questionnaire GETs | 100 | 277 |
| Questionnaire POSTs | 121 | 337 |
| All requests | 110 | 307 |

### Datastore Metrics

Datastore's read/writes metrics for a single test run. These metrics were consistent between tests.

| Metric | Baseline | Investigation |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Reads per second | 115 | 105 |
| Writes per second| 55 | 50 |

#### Datastore Latency reported by New Relic

Top 3 most time-consuming routes. These are averages between all test runs.

| Route (avg % time spent) | Baseline | Investigation |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| app.routes.questionnaire.block (93%) | 20.5ms | 34.4ms |
| app.routes.questionnaire.get_questionnaire (2%)| 12.3ms | 20.5ms |
| app.routes.questionnaire.post_questionnaire (2%) | 17.7ms | 28.9ms |

## Conclusion

The observed performance loss during testing with the investigation candidate indicates there could potentially be some bottleneck/issue with the way we currently set up the Datastore client. Therefore, an investigation should be carried out to identify the cause of this issue.
