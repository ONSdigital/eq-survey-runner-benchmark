# Use Redis for storing Questionnaire Runner sessions

EQ session data are currently stored in Datastore. It may be more performant to store these data in Redis (which is already used for JWT).

## Results

### Baseline

| Clients, Hatch rate | GET Average (ms) | POST Average (ms) | All requests average (ms) |
|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 1, 1 | 103 | 123 | 410 |
| 5, 5 | 138 | 157 | 270 |
| 25, 25 | 462 | 416 | 1200 |
| 50, 50 | 928 | 997 | 1600 |

### Investigation

| Clients & hatch rate | GET Average (ms) | POST Average (ms) | All requests average (ms) |
|----------------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| 1, 1 | 95 | 110 | 490 |
| 5, 5 | 121 | 141 | 280 |
| 25, 25 | 353 | 422 | 570 |
| 50, 50 | 387 | 451 | 550 |

## Results

Performance with Datastore degrades more quickly than Redis as the number of client connections increases.

## Decision

Merge.
